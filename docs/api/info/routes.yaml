      summary: Information
      description: |
        This route returns public information about the Readeck instance.

        The `version` entry contains information about the currently running version, with
        the following fields:

        | Name        | Description
        | :---------- | :----------
        | `release`   | The major + minor + patch number
        | `canonical` | The full version; release + build number
        | `build`     | The build number, if any.

        On a stable release, `build` is empty and `release` is the same as `canonical`. On a nightly
        build, `build` contains the commit information. It looks like `175-g154ad5c1` where the
        first number is always incrementing one version after another.

        `features` is a list that advertises the available features. It can contain the following
        values:

        | Name        | Description
        | :---------- | :----------
        | `email`     | This instance can send emails
        | `oauth`     | This instance support OAuth
