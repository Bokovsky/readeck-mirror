    # Introduction

    The Readeck API provides REST endpoints that can be used for any purpose, should it be a
    mobile application, a script, you name it.

    ## API Endpoint

    You can access this API on `__BASE_URI__`.

    Most of your requests and responses are using JSON as the exchange format.

    ## Authentication

    To use the API, you first need to [create an authentication token](../profile/tokens). You can
    then use your new token using the `Bearer` HTTP authorization scheme.

    For example, you first request will look like:

    ```sh
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" __BASE_URI__/bookmarks
    ```

    Or, in NodeJS:

    ```js
    fetch("__BASE_URI__/bookmarks", {
      headers: {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN>",
      },
    })
    ```

    ## First time authentication

    While you can create an authentication token from Readeck, you can also get one directly from
    the API. This provides a mechanism to ask for user credentials and obtain a token for your app
    only.

    Please refer to [POST /auth](#post-/auth) for more information.

    ## Test the API

    On this documentation, you can test every route.

    If you don't provide an API token in [Authentication](#auth), you can still test all the routes
    but note that the given curl examples only work with an API token.
